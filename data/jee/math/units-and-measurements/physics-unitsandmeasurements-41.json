  "explanation_html": "Given the equation,\n\n$ Y = c^\\alpha h^\\beta G^\\gamma $\n\n<br><br>where Y represents Young's modulus, c the speed of light, h is Planck's constant, G is the gravitational constant, and α, β, and γ are powers to be determined. \n\n<br><br>We start by expressing the quantities involved in terms of their fundamental dimensions: Mass (M), Length (L), and Time (T). The equation in terms of dimensions is :\n\n<br><br>$ [M^1 L^{-1} T^{-2}] = [M^0 L^1 T^{-1}]^\\alpha [M^1 L^2 T^{-1}]^\\beta [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]^\\gamma $\n\n<br><br>Next, by equating the powers of the dimensions M, L, and T on both sides of the equation, we form three separate equations:\n\n<br><br>1. Equating the powers of M, we get : $ \\beta - \\gamma = 1 $\n<br><br>2. Equating the powers of L, we get : $ \\alpha + 2\\beta + 3\\gamma = -1 $\n<br><br>3. Equating the powers of T, we get : $ -\\alpha - \\beta - 2\\gamma = -2 $\n\n<br><br>Now we can solve this system of equations. \n\n<br><br>From the first equation, we get $ \\beta = \\gamma + 1 $.\n\n<br><br>Substituting $ \\beta $ from the first equation into the second and third equations, we get :\n\n<br><br>For the second equation, substituting $ \\beta $ we get : $ \\alpha + 2(\\gamma + 1) + 3\\gamma = -1 $, which simplifies to $ \\alpha = -5\\gamma - 3 $.\n\n<br><br>For the third equation, substituting $ \\beta $ we get : $ -\\alpha - (\\gamma + 1) - 2\\gamma = -2 $, which simplifies to $ \\alpha = -3\\gamma - 1 $.\n\n<br><br>Setting the two equations for $ \\alpha $ equal to each other gives : $ -5\\gamma - 3 = -3\\gamma - 1 $, which simplifies to $ \\gamma = -2 $.\n\n<br><br>Substituting $ \\gamma = -2 $ back into the equations for $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $ we find $ \\alpha = 7 $ and $ \\beta = -1 $.\n\n<br><br>So, the solution to the system is $ \\alpha = 7, \\beta = -1, \\gamma = -2 $, which corresponds to Option A."

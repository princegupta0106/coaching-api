  "question_html": "A steel wire of diameter $$0.5$$ $$mm$$ and Young's modulus $$2 \\times {10^{11}}\\,\\,N{m^{ - 2}}$$ carries a load of mass $$M.$$ The length of the wire with the load is $$1.0$$ $$m.A$$ vernier scale with $$10$$ divisions is attached to the end of this wire. Next to the steel wire is a reference wire to which a main scale, of least count $$1.0$$ $$mm$$ , is attached. The $$10$$ divisions of the vernier scale correspond to $$9$$ divisions of the main scale. Initially, the zero of vernier scale coincides with the zero of main scale. If the load on the steel wire is increased by  $$1.2$$ $$kg,$$ the vernier scale division which coincides with a main scale division is _____________. Take $$g = 10\\,m\\,{s^{ - 2}}.$$  and $$\\pi  = 3.2.$$",

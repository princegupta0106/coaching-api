  "question_html": "In Searle's experiment, which is used to find Young's Modulus of elasticity, the diameter of experimental wire is D = 0.05 cm ( measured by a scale of least count 0.001 cm ) and length is L = 110 cm ( measured by a scale of least count 0.1 cm ). A weight of 50 N causes an extension of X = 0.125 cm (measured by a micrometer of least count 0.001 cm ). Find maximum possible error in the value of Young's modulus. Screw gauge and and meter scale are free from error.",

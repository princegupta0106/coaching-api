  "explanation_html": "The distance moved on the linear scale when circular scale makes one complete rotation is p = 1 mm (pitch). The number of divisions on the circular scale is N = 100. Thus, one division on the circular scale is LC = $${p \\over N} = {1 \\over {100}}$$ = 0.01 mm. The linear scale reading (LSR) is 1 mm and the circular scale reading (CSR) is 47. Thus, the diameter of the wire is<br><br>d = LSR + CSR $$\\times$$ LC<br><br>= 1 + 47 $$\\times$$ 0.01 = 1.47 mm = 0.147 cm.<br><br>The curved surface area is S = 2$$\\pi$$rL.

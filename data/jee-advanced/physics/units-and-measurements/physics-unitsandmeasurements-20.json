  "explanation_html": "<p>The difference between the two measurements by Vernier scale gives elongation of the wire caused by the additional load of 2 kg. In the first measurement, main scale reading is MSR = 3.20 $$\\times$$ 10<sup>$$-$$2</sup> m and Vernier scale reading is VSR = 20. The least count of Vernier scale is LC = 1 $$\\times$$ 10<sup>$$-$$5</sup> m.
